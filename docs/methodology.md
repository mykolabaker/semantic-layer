# Semantic Layer Pipeline Methodology

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the methodology used in the Semantic Layer Pipeline, including LLM prompting strategies, validation approaches, and key design decisions.

## LLM Prompting Strategy

### Two-Phase Approach

**Phase 1: Entity Identification**
- Purpose: Identify 5-7 core business entities from database schema
- Input: Complete database metadata + business documentation
- Output: Structured list of entities with rationale
- Technique: Chain-of-thought reasoning with business context

**Phase 2: Detailed Entity Generation**
- Purpose: Generate precise SQL definitions for each entity
- Input: Focused entity context + relevant table schemas
- Output: Complete entity definition with base_query, attributes, relations
- Technique: Few-shot learning with detailed examples

### Prompt Engineering Techniques

1. **Chain-of-Thought Instructions**: Guide LLM through step-by-step reasoning
2. **Few-Shot Examples**: Provide high-quality example entity definitions
3. **Structured Output**: Explicit JSON schema requirements
4. **Business Context**: Include Northwind business documentation
5. **Constraint Specification**: Clear naming conventions and SQL standards

## Validation Methodology

### Multi-Layered Validation

**Layer 1: Structural Validation**
- Tool: Pydantic models
- Purpose: Ensure JSON schema compliance
- Speed: Fastest validation check

**Layer 2: SQL Syntax Validation**
- Tool: Database query execution
- Purpose: Verify SQL syntax correctness
- Method: Execute LIMIT 1 queries for each entity

**Layer 3: Semantic Validation**
- Tool: Business metric comparison
- Purpose: Ensure logical accuracy
- Method: Compare calculated values against known metrics

### Validation Feedback Loop

Failed entities trigger automatic LLM re-generation with error context, enabling self-correction of common issues.

## Design Decisions

### Architecture Choices

1. **Modular Design**: Separation of concerns with clear interfaces
2. **Configuration Management**: Centralized settings for maintainability
3. **Caching Strategy**: File-based LLM response caching for cost efficiency
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff

### LLM Provider Strategy

- Support for both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs
- Abstract provider interface for easy extension
- Model-specific optimization parameters

## Assumptions

1. **Database Access**: Stable connection to Northwind database
2. **Business Context**: Northwind documentation accurately reflects data
3. **LLM Capabilities**: Models can understand complex SQL generation tasks
4. **Validation Metrics**: Known business metrics are accurate benchmarks

## Performance Considerations

- **API Costs**: Caching reduces redundant LLM calls during development
- **Execution Time**: Multi-layered validation balances speed vs accuracy
- **Memory Usage**: Streaming approach for large schema processing

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Schema Support**: Adapt to changing database structures
2. **Custom Validation Rules**: User-defined business logic validation
3. **Interactive Refinement**: Human-in-the-loop entity refinement
4. **Multi-Database Support**: Extend beyond SQLite to other database types
