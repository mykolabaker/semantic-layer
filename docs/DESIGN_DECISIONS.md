## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Modular Component Architecture

**Decision**: Implement a clear separation of concerns with distinct modules for database inspection, LLM interaction, validation, and orchestration.

**Rationale**:
- **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused in different contexts
- **Debugging**: Easier to isolate and debug issues

**Implementation**:
```
src/
├── db_inspector.py     # Database introspection
├── llm_service.py      # LLM communication
├── validation.py       # Multi-layer validation
├── orchestrator.py     # Pipeline coordination
├── config.py          # Configuration management
└── models.py          # Data validation models
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Clear boundaries, easier maintenance, better testability
- **Cons**: More complex initial setup, potential over-engineering for simple use cases

### 2. Two-Phase LLM Processing

**Decision**: Split LLM processing into Entity Identification and Entity Details phases.

**Rationale**:
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**: Simpler, focused tasks for each LLM call
- **Quality Improvement**: Allows the LLM to build conceptual understanding before details
- **Error Isolation**: Failures in one phase don't affect the other
- **Iterative Refinement**: Can improve each phase independently

**Implementation**:
```python
# Phase 1: Identify business entities
entities = self.identify_business_entities()

# Phase 2: Generate detailed definitions
semantic_layer = self.generate_entity_definitions(entities)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Higher quality output, better error handling, more focused prompts
- **Cons**: Increased API calls and latency, more complex orchestration

### 3. Fail-Fast Validation Pipeline

**Decision**: Implement progressive validation layers that stop on critical failures.

**Rationale**:
- **Resource Efficiency**: Don't waste time on expensive validation if basic structure is wrong
- **Clear Error Attribution**: Know exactly which validation layer failed
- **User Experience**: Provide immediate feedback on structural issues

**Implementation**:
```python
# Stop immediately if structural validation fails
if not struct_valid:
    results["overall_valid"] = False
    return results

# Continue to SQL validation only if structure is valid
# Continue to semantic validation regardless of SQL failures (warnings only)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Fast feedback, resource efficiency, clear error messages
- **Cons**: Less comprehensive validation reports for early failures

## Technology Choices

### 1. Python as Primary Language

**Decision**: Use Python for the entire pipeline implementation.

**Rationale**:
- **LLM Ecosystem**: Excellent libraries for LLM integration (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- **Data Processing**: Strong ecosystem for data manipulation (pandas, json, sqlite3)

**Implementation**:
```python
class EntityModel(BaseModel):
    description: str = Field(..., description="Entity description")
    base_query: str = Field(..., description="Base SQL query for the entity")
    attributes: Dict[str, AttributeModel] = Field(..., description="Entity attributes")

    @validator("base_query")
    def validate_base_query(cls, v):
        if not v.strip().upper().startswith("SELECT"):
            raise ValueError("base_query must be a SELECT statement")
        return v
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Excellent error messages, type safety, JSON integration
- **Cons**: Additional dependency, learning curve for complex validations

### 4. Environment Variable Configuration

**Decision**: Use environment variables for all configuration with .env file support.

- **Reliability**: Fallback options if one provider has issues
- **Feature Comparison**: Ability to compare model capabilities

**Implementation**:
```python
class LLMProvider(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_response(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> str:
        pass

class OpenAIProvider(LLMProvider): ...
class AnthropicProvider(LLMProvider): ...
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Flexibility, vendor independence, cost optimization
- **Cons**: More complex implementation, testing across multiple providers

### 2. Response Caching Strategy

```python
def get_cache_key(self, prompt: str, model: str) -> str:
    content = f"{model}:{prompt}"
    return hashlib.sha256(content.encode()).hexdigest()
```

**Assumptions**:
- Deterministic responses are acceptable for caching
- File system access is available and reliable
- Cache invalidation isn't needed (content-based keys)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Significant cost savings, faster development
- **Cons**: Potential stale data, disk space usage, cache management complexity

### 3. JSON Response Processing

**Decision**: Support both direct JSON and markdown-wrapped JSON responses.

**Rationale**:
- **LLM Flexibility**: Different models format JSON responses differently
- **Robustness**: Handle various response formats gracefully
- **User Experience**: Reduce failures due to response formatting

**Implementation**:
```python
if "```json" in response:
    cleaned_response = self._extract_json_from_markdown(response)
    parsed_response = json.loads(cleaned_response)
else:
    parsed_response = json.loads(response)
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Higher success rate, model flexibility
- **Cons**: More complex parsing logic, potential edge cases

- **Development Efficiency**: Easier to debug specific entity issues

**Implementation**:
```python
def handle_validation_failures(self, semantic_layer, validation_results):
    failed_entities = self.validator.get_failed_entities(validation_results)
    for entity_key in failed_entities:
        if entity_key in entities:
            del entities[entity_key]
    return semantic_layer
```

**Trade-offs**:
- **Pros**: Better user experience, partial success possible
- **Cons**: Silent failures, potential incomplete semantic layers

### 3. Business Metrics Validation

**Decision**: Use known Northwind business metrics for semantic validation.

**Rationale**:
- **Quality Assurance**: Verify generated entities produce reasonable results
- **Business Alignment**: Ensure semantic layer reflects real business understanding
- **Automatic Quality Control**: Detect logical errors in entity definitions

**Metrics Used**:
```python
business_metrics = {
    "average_order_value": 1274,
    "average_items_per_order": 2.6,
    "total_orders": 830,
    "total_customers": 91,
    # ... other metrics
}
```

**Assumptions**:
- Northwind metrics are accurate and current
- Generated entities should align with these business patterns
- 10% tolerance is acceptable for metric variations

## Performance and Scalability Decisions
